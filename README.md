# 👑 Cryptonia – The Kingdom Built on Blockchain

Welcome to **Cryptonia**, a Web3-based micronation where citizens govern themselves through a DAO, conquer digital lands, and rise through a medieval-fantasy world driven by smart contracts and real economic value.

## 🏰 What is Cryptonia?

Cryptonia is a gamified sovereign ecosystem that merges:
- **DAO governance** for collective decision-making
- **Smart contracts** to manage lands, titles, and guilds
- **A fixed-supply token** ($KGC – KingCoin) as the core currency
- **Narrative progression** through Legendary Places and Feudal Politics

Powered by Avalanche blockchain and built for decentralization, Cryptonia is more than a game: it's a living story shaped by its community.
